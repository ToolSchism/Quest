Hello and welcome to Rogue of the Waves, a turn based roguelike RPG wave battler inspired by early Epic Battle Fantasy and of course classic JRPGS.

Fight endless waves of enemies and level up, getting gold and souls on the way to buy temporary and permanent (small) upgrades. Collect artifacts to make your runs incredibly powerful, with effects as simple as gaining crit chance to as complex as 10 artifact builds dedicated to freezing, stunning, trapping, and so on enemies and stacking insane damage multipliers on incapacitated foes.

How far can you make it?! My record is wave 219 :)
